# Jenkins X Lab Quickstart

This repository hosts a lab documentation for a Jenkins X Quickstart tutorial. It is divided in the following topics:

* Creating a CI/CD Cloud Native (K8s) cluster with Jenkins X installed - [Go to section](labs/JXCreateCluster.md)
* Creating a first quickstart application using Jenkins X capabilities - [Go to section](labs/JXQuickstart.md)
* Doing a Pull Request in GitHub and showing Preview Environments with Jenkins X - [Go to section](labs/JXPullRequest.md)
* Promoting your quickstart application into Production with automated Jenkins X capabilities - [Go to section](labs/JXPromotion.md)

## What you need to know

This lab is focused on intermediate level knowledge of CI/CD and Kubernetes Cloud Native development. So, it's going to be easier for you if you know about the following:

* Kubernetes basic concepts
* CI/CD pipelines knowledge
* Jenkins or CloudBees CI/CD tools understanding
* Google Cloud Platform basic usage
* Software development and Git branching notions
* Linux/Unix command line based experience

Anyway, don't worry if you don't know about these because you stil can do the lab. But it will take more time to finish if you want to understand every concept.
