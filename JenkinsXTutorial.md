# Jenkins X introduction

[![Open in Cloud Shell](https://gstatic.com/cloudssh/images/open-btn.png)](https://console.cloud.google.com/cloudshell/open?git_repo=https://github.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-workshop&tutorial=JenkinsXTutorial.md)

[Jenkins X](https://jenkins-x.io/) is the Cloud Native implementation of Jenkins. By leveraging Kubernetes and using CRDs (Custom Resource Definitions) it allows you to execute your CI/CD pipelines with no expert Kubernetes knowledge required. It uses containers orchestration and development buildpacks to automate the development experience to deliver your applications.

The following concepts and components are essential in order to understand Jenkins X capabilities:

* [GitOps](https://www.weave.works/technologies/gitops/) promotions to promote your application
* [DevPods](https://jenkins-x.io/developing/devpods/) to provide development tools in sync with promotion environments
* [Build packs](https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/build-packs/) as development templates
* Powerful CLI to automate the CI/CD process and to provide Kubernetes tooling abstraction
* Automated [preview environments](https://jenkins-x.io/developing/preview/) to support pull or change requests
* [Jenkins X pipeline](https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/jenkins-x-pipelines/) engine for serverless capabilities (based on [Tekton CD](https://cloud.google.com/tekton/))

In this lab you will use Jenkins X as the Cloud Native CI/CD orchestrator to deploy a quickstart [Go application from a build pack](https://github.com/jenkins-x-buildpacks/jenkins-x-kubernetes/tree/master/packs/go) and use some of the Jenkins X features to work on a change request that needs to be delivered into production.

## What you’ll do

* Install Jenkins X in a GKE Cluster
* Use Kubernetes namespaces in GKE as deployment environments
* Create a Quickstart Project from a build pack
* Leverage Preview Environments for Pull Requests
* Promote your changes into Production

GitOps promotions is applied for all the development process to promote the application:

[![GitOps Image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-workshop/master/images/JXGitOps.png)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-workshop/master/images/JXGitOps.png)

* By creating a Pull Request the preview chart included in the buildpack is applied and deployed in a namespace that Jenkins X creates automatically as Preview Environment
* When the pull request is merged (it is done automatically in serverless by using ChatOps in GitHub) Jenkins X deploys into Staging by changing the version in Staging Git repo and then deploying the application chart in the staging namespace in Kubernetes
* Once a promotion to Production is triggered (needs to be triggered manually as a production environment) Jenkins X creates a pull request in the production Git repo to change the version, merges it and then deploy the chart into Production namespace in Kubernetes.

> Note:
>     If no parameter is specified Jenkins X by default creates a namespace per environment in the same Kubernetes cluster (jx, jx-staging and jx-production). In this lab this default behaviour is used.But a more real scenario would be using different K8s clusters per environment. This can be done in Jenkins X by using ‘--remote-environments’ parameter when creating the cluster or just ‘--remote’ when editing current environments. This is possible by the Multi-cluster capabilities of Jenkins X_

## Setup
This lab will create a Kubernetes cluster using Google Container Engine (GKE) and will require connections to GitHub repositories. The following sections detail all the requirements you need in order to follow the Jenkins X lab.

### What you'll need
To complete this lab, you’ll need:
* A GitHub account to use for the Jenkins X configuration flow. This is mandatory, if you don't have one or you do not want to mess up your existing one, go now and [create one](https://github.com/join)
* Access to a standard internet browser (Chrome browser recommended).
* Time. It shouldn't take you more than 1,5 hours to read and finish everything (including setup), but depends on interruptions and how you plan your time. Then, plan your schedule so you have time to complete the lab. Follow the Google Cloud Shell tutorial in the right side of your screen 
* You need a Google Cloud Platform account or project. You can use a [Free Tier Google account to create one](https://cloud.google.com/free/) or your own. 
* If you already have your own GCP account, bear in mind that charges may apply if Free Tier is expired

### Google Cloud Shell tutorial

This lab tutorial is designed to be followed by [Cloud Shell Tutorials](https://cloud.google.com/shell/docs/tutorials), so you will be able to open by clicking button in the top of this page (if you didn't already).

You just need to follow all steps that you can find in the menu on the left side of the page. If you closed the Tutorial accidentally, you can restart it by executing in the Cloud Shell the following command:

```bash
cloudshell launch-tutorial $HOME/jenkins-x-workshop/JenkinsXTutorial.md
```

Also, to be able to create the Kubernetes cluster and work with your project, ensure you have created or selected the GCP project where you want to work:

<walkthrough-project-setup>
</walkthrough-project-setup>

You can copy all the commands to the shell just by clicking the copy icon.

## Install the Jenkins X CLI binary

There is a script included in this repo to install Jenkins X CLI depending on your platform (Linux or MacOS) and the Jenkins X distribution (CloudBees or OSS). For this lab we are using Jenkins OSS, so just execute the following to install CLI version 2.0.420 (Please, **see the note below if you want to work with the latest version**):

```bash
./install-jx.sh -v 2.0.420
```

Similar expected output (do not copy)

> **Note:**
> You can work with the latest version of Jenkins X OSS or CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution, but in this case you will need to upgrade the Git version installed in the Google Cloud Shell. The git version required is 2.15+. You can upgrade the Git client in the shell by doing the following:
> ```
> $ sudo apt update
> $ sudo apt install make libssl-dev libghc-zlib-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev gettext unzip
> $ cd /usr/src/
> $ sudo wget https://github.com/git/git/archive/v2.23.0.tar.gz -O git.tar.gz
> $ sudo tar -xf git.tar.gz
> $ cd git-2.23.0/
> $ sudo make prefix=/usr/local all
> $ sudo make prefix=/usr/local install
> $ git version
> ```
> 
> If you want to work with the CloudBees Jenkins X Distribution, you can do it by:
> 
> ```bash
> ./install-jx -c
> ```
> 
> And if you want to work with the latest OSS version:
> ```bash
> ./install-jx
> ```

You can find also the [manual steps to install Jenkins X CLI](https://jenkins-x.io/getting-started/install/) in Jenkins X documentation

## Create a Cluster

We are going to create a Kubernetes cluster with a Jenkins X platform deployed using the Jenkins X CLI. You will see that having a ready CI/CD Cloud Native platform from scratch is just a matter of minutes by executing some easy commands from the CLI.

### Prepare the environment
Make sure the Google Cloud project you're working on is the one selected in the Cloud Web Console. This should be the case if you opened Cloud Shell with the right project selected:

```bash
gcloud config list project
```

Output (do not copy)
```
[core]
project = <your-project-id>
Your active configuration is: [cloudshell-30655]
```

If the output is not showing the proper project id, get it from the Google Console top menu and set it up with the following command:

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
```

Now that your project ID is set, export the value to a shell variable for later use:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

### Create the cluster and install Jenkins X

Let's create a GKE cluster to host Jenkins X. To create the cluster, run the jx tool with the following options, substituting the zone for one that's more suitable to you depending on your physical location:

```bash
jx create cluster gke --no-tiller --default-admin-password=admin \
--project-id=${PROJECT_ID} --cluster-name=jenkins-x-lab --zone=europe-west1-d \
--min-num-nodes 4 --max-num-nodes 6 --advanced-mode \
--version=2.0.1128 --skip-login
```

This command is interactive; it will guide you through creating a cluster on GKE by prompting you to answer some questions. Read on to know how to continue.

#### Missing Dependencies

The jx command will attempt to locate any required dependencies first (particularly, Helm), if it discovers that some are missing (it will ask you to install helm, for example) it will prompt to install them for you in the ~/.jx/bin folder. Just answer yes for jx to install whatever dependencies are required.

#### Configure you cluster

Follow the prompt to provide the following answers:
* Google Cloud Machine Type: n1-standard-2
* Minimum number of Nodes: 4
* Maximum number of Nodes: 6
* Would you like use preemptible VMs: N
* Would you like to access Google Cloud Storage / Google Container Registry: Y
* Would you like to enable Cloud Build, Container Registry & Container Analysis APIs:  Y
* Would you like to enable Kaniko for building container images: Y

Now jx is using the Google Cloud SDK to create a GKE cluster with the provided parameters. It will take some time before continuing with the configuration (up to five minutes), and will output something like this:

Output (do not copy)

```
INFO[0244] Creating cluster...
```

#### GitHub Connectivity and default workload

Once the cluster is created, the jx execution continues and you will be prompted for some configuration options. There will be some delays between prompts when the jx command proceeds with different installation actions; just follow these answers for the different steps and you should be good to go:
1. Select Jenkins installation type:  **Serverless Jenkins X Pipelines with Tekton**
2. Please enter the name you wish to use with git: **enter your GitHub user as Git user**
3. Please enter the email address you wish to use with git: **enter your GitHub email as Git email address**
4. No existing ingress controller found in the kube-system namespace, shall we install one? **Y**
5. Domain **<your-ip>**.nip.io **Accept the proposed domain by pressing Enter**
6. Would you like to enable Long Term Storage? A bucket for provider gke will be created (Y/n) **Y**
7. GitHub user name: **enter your GitHub username**
8. API Token: **copy here the API Token generated in the GitHub page presented to you when you followed the suggested URL link in the terminal**
9. Do you wish to use GitHub as the pipelines Git server: **Yes**
10. API Token: **copy here the API Token generated in the GitHub page presented to you when you followed the suggested URL link in the terminal. Be careful, this is a new API token, different from the previous one**.
Now the installer will take a bit of time before continuing with the next steps.
11. Pick default workload build pack:   select the option **Kubernetes Workloads: Automated CI+CD with GitOps Promotion**
12. Select the organization where you want to create the environment repository: **select here the GitHub organization you have already configured**

> **Note:** the nip.io service you just used is just a way to have a static domain based on your IP.

The jx command should exit successfully showing an output similar to this:

(Output)

```
Jenkins X installation completed successfully

#### What did Jenkins X just install?

Jenkins X installs different components in order to orchestrate Cloud Native CI/CD. These can be summarized conceptually as:
* Prow (Serverless Jenkins X): A webhook handler that listens to GitHub events and that uses ChatOps to trigger jobs to execute your pipeline
* Tekton: Using [tekton pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) and Jenkins X controller a pipeline is decoupled into tasks and pipeline resources that are Kubernetes native objects
* Chartmuseum: Helm chart repository to publish different charts to be used during pipeline execution
* Nexus: Artifact cache management that can be required by some applications during the building or deployment
* Monocular: UI used for discovering and running Helm charts
The more detailed architecture of Jenkins X using Tekton (Serverless Jenkins X) can be described below:

![Tekton Jenkins X Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-lab/master/images/TektonJXArch.png)

This is deployed to different pods and services in our development ‘jx’ namespace. So, let's take a look at what got installed based on the previous architecture diagram:

```bash
kubectl -n jx get pods
```

```

Jenkins X also created several secrets that it's using to authenticate to different services. You can have a look at them by running kubectl get secrets and observing how, for instance, there's a kaniko-secret stored to be used with Kaniko.
The jx command can also give you entry URLs for different services deployed by Jenkins X:

```bash
jx get urls
```

```

Note the deck URL that corresponds to Prow as we'll be using it to check that we're properly triggering  pipelines from GitHub events.
It is also now a good moment to have a look at how Jenkins X has created the environments and corresponding GitOps git repos,  as well as a default promotion strategy:

```bash
jx get environments
```

Output (do not copy)

```
NAME       LABEL       KIND        PROMOTE NAMESPACE     ORDER CLUSTER SOURCE                                                                       REF PR
dev        Development Development Never   jx            0

production Production  Permanent   Manual  jx-production 200           https://github.com/dcanadillas-kube/environment-jenkins-x-lab-production.git
```

Note the following details in the PROMOTE column:
* Development follows a **Never** promotion strategy, because we're not actually deploying anything and you're working locally.
* Staging follows a default **Auto** promotion strategy, meaning that any merge performed on the application's repo master branch will automatically deployed as a new version to staging.
* Production follows a **Manual** promotion strategy, meaning that you will use a jx promotion command to promote your staging application version into production.

SOURCE column reflects the corresponding environment configuration git repo.

## Create a Quickstart Project

Quickstarts are very basic pre-made applications you can start a project from, instead of creating a project from scratch. You can create new applications from a list of curated Quickstart applications via the jx create quickstart command.
Let's do that, but before creating our quickstart application create first a directory to store your work:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/jx-gke-lab && cd ~/jx-gke-lab
```

The following set of commands will be run from this directory.

Create now a Golang Quickstart with the following command:

```bash
jx create quickstart -l go -f golang-http -p jx-go-http -b
```

Output (do not copy)

```

Watch pipeline activity via:    jx get activity -f jx-go-http -w
Browse the pipeline log via:    jx get build logs dcanadillas/jx-go-http/master
You can list the pipelines via: jx get pipelines
When the pipeline is complete:  jx get applications

For more help on available commands see: https://jenkins-x.io/developing/browsing/
```

Note that your first pipeline may take a few minutes to start while the necessary images get downloaded!

Here's a brief explanation of what you just run:
* -l go will filter the list of available quickstarts to a specific language - Go in this case -.
* -f http will filter quickstarts in the previously selected language which name contains the string http
* -p jx-go-http will set jx-go-http as the application project name (application and git repo name). 
* -b launches the command in batch mode, so you do not need to interactively answer any questions

> **Note:** You can run the previous command without the ‘-b’ option (non-batch), so it uses the interactive mode. In this case you don’t need to use ‘-p jx-go-http’. The command would be like:
> 
> `$> jx create quickstart -l go`
> 
> In interactive mode you would be asked for the following:
> * **Git user name?** select your GitHub username that is going to develop and be the owner of the repo. This GitHub user can be different from the pipeline GitHub username that you used on Jenkins installation
> * **Which organisation do you want to use?** The GitHub organization where you want the repository to be created
> * **Enter the new repository name:** Enter a repository name that is going to be created. This step is the one that is selected with the -p option used in batch-mode
> **Would you like to initialise git now? (Y/n)** Type Y (or press Enter) to initialize git in the directory where the local repo is create
> **Commit message:  (Initial import)** Press Enter to select the default message “Initial import” or just type your first commit message of the repo to be created

By executing this command, Jenkins X has performed a set of actions belonging to this specific quickstart (you can follow the steps in the output the previous command generated):
* Based on the language selected it recognizes using [Draft](https://draft.sh/) the specific Jenkins X [buildpack](https://jenkins-x.io/architecture/build-packs/).
* Based on this buildpack it creates a new application in a local sub directory. 
* Adds your source code into a local git repository.
* Adds the following default files:
  * Dockerfile to build your application as a docker image.
  * `jenkins-x.yml` file implementing a Jenkins X CI/CD pipeline.
  * Helm chart to run your application inside Kubernetes (inside `charts/` directory).
  * Preview chart with dependencies to create preview environments (also inside `charts/` directory).
* Creates a remote git repository on a git service, such as GitHub (the one you just configured)
* Pushes your local code to the remote git service.
* Registers a webhook on the remote git repository.
* Triggers the pipeline for the first time.

Now run the following command to monitor the pipeline activity in watch mode (`-w` option):

```bash
jx get activity -f jx-go-http -w
```

Up to this point, you didn't check what the pipeline you just launched is doing. However, you should see the steps now being executed and the status of the different steps. 
Press **CTRL+C** to exit the activity view watch mode.

To browse the pipeline detailed log, run the following jx command:

```bash
jx get build logs
```

When the pipeline is complete (meaning all activities have a Succeeded/Failed status), you can have a look at your deployed applications versions  in Jenkins X by typing:

```bash
jx get version
```

```

## Doing a pull request

Once we checked that our first 0.0.1 version is deployed into Staging, let’s change our application in a different git branch and create a pull request to merge into master.

### Creating the GitHub Pull Request

Let’s get into the local git repo:

```bash
cd ~/jx-gke-lab/jx-go-http
```

Then, create a new branch for the pull request and check it out from your Cloud Shell:

```bash
git checkout -b my-pr
```

Open the Cloud Shell editor and update the main.go file:

```bash
cloudshell edit main.go
```

The Cloud Shell editor should open the file, that you can now edit graphically.  Update line 10 so it the variable title has a new value. The new line should like like this:

        title := "Jenkins X golang http example by <your name>"

When done, press Ctrl + S (or Command + S if you're using a Mac).
Now, stage the change for commit and commit the change to GitHub:

```bash
git add main.go
git commit -m "New welcome message"
```

Finally, push the changes to GitHub:

```bash
git push --set-upstream origin my-pr
```

Now we are ready to create the Pull Request (PR). So, let’s use the GitHub web console to create the pull request with the changes you pushed from your “my-pr” branch:
* Go to https://github.com/<your_github_username>/jx-go-http
* Check that your changes are waiting for creating the PR and select “Compare & pull request” (DON’T FORGET TO SIGN IN INTO GITHUB!)
* Then edit your PR message (e.g. “New welcome message”)
* Check your changes 

Here you have some screenshots to see the process:

![Compare and PR in GirHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-workshop/master/images/GitHubPR.png)

![Create a GitHub PR](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-workshop/master/images/GHCreatePR.png)

> **Note:** Instead of using GitHub web console you can also create the pull request directly from Jenkins X with the following command
> 
> `$> jx create pr -t “New welcome message” `
> 
> Open then the link that is the output of the command and you go directly to the pull request created.

### Preview the application and approve the Pull Request

Once the Pull Request is created on GitHub we sould use the Prow commands to approve the pull request via ChatOps, so then the merge and pipelines are triggered automatically once one of the approvers in the “OWNERS” file of the application repo select `/approve` or `/lgtm` (Looks Good to Me). 

The following actions happened automatically when we created the PR:
* An approval notifier is saying that “This PR is NOT APPROVED” and suggest some ChatOps commands that can be used from Prow
  
![Approval Notifier in GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-workshop/master/images/GHPRApprovalNotifier.png)
  
* Then, a size label is attached to the change proposed in the PR (size/XS) in this case

![Automated Jenkins X label](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-workshop/master/images/GHLabel.png)

* After a minute more or less a Preview environment is created and deployed

```bash
jx get activity -f dcanadillas/jx-go-http/PR-1
```

You can check the preview environment by:

```bash
jx get previews
```

Output (do not copy)

```

```

So, you can check the application preview environment by going to the previous URL in the output of ‘jx get previews’. There you should see your changes in Development to be merged into Master and then to be able to deploy a new version into Staging:

![Preview of Staging](images/GHPreviewPR.png)

In this lab we didn’t configure a different GitHub user to act as “a bot” so you cannot approve your own PR with the `/approve` command of Prow. So, in this case we will close the PR manually to trigger the promotion pipeline into Staging:

![Merging manually the PR](images/GHMergePR.png)

> **Note:**
> 
> During the installation process you could have configured a different GitHub user for the “Pipeline Server”. This user then act as a “bot” to generate the comments automatically in the Pull Request to work with Prow.
> 
> Then, you could approve a pull request just by commenting “/approve” in the PR messages if you are one of the approvers defined in the repo `OWNERS` file.
> ![Approve Prow command in GitHub](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-workshop/master/images/ApproveProw.png)

This should trigger the promotion pipeline into Staging. Let’s check the execution:

```bash
jx get activity -f jx-go-http -w
```

Once we check in the previous output that the Pull Request #2 is succeeded, we can see our new version deployed:

```bash
jx get version
```

Output (do not copy)

```
APPLICATION STAGING PODS URL
jx-go-http  0.0.2   1/1  http://jx-go-http.jx-staging.35.189.194.245.nip.io
```

Let’s check the application deployed into staging by:

```bash
jx open jx-go-http -e staging
```

If we open the output url shown from the previous output in a browser tab the new version 0.0.2 of the application with the changes is shown.

## Promote to Production

Let’s check the current releases that are deployed on the whole cluster:

```bash
jx get releases
```

Output (do not copy)

```sh
NAME            VERSION
jx-go-http        0.0.2
jx-go-http        0.0.1
```

And now let’s check current version deployed into staging

```bash
jx get version -e staging
```

Output (do not copy)

```sh
APPLICATION STAGING PODS URL
jx-go-http  0.0.2   1/1  http://jx-go-http.jx-staging.35.189.194.245.nip.io
```

Let’s say that we want to deploy version 0.0.2 into Production:

```bash
jx promote -a jx-go-http -e production -v 0.0.2
```

You may be asked for your GitHub credentials:
* Username for 'https://github.com': **Use your GitHub username**
* Password for 'https://<your_username>@github.com': **Use your API Token**
? Do you wish to use <previous_username>  as the user name to comment on issues **Press Enter for default value (Yes)**

The previous command is defined by different parameters:
* -a: The application to promote (jx-go-http in this lab)
* -e: The environment where the application is going to be promoted and deployed
* -v: The version of the application to promote/deploy

> **Note:** The promotion command can be executed with no parameters, so a wizard is going to ask about the actions to take from promotion taking the local repository
> 
> `$> jx promote `
> 
> ? Pick environment:  [Use arrows to move, space to select, type to filter]
   staging
> **production**
> ...

The promotion process takes different steps:
* Creates a PR in Production git repo (https://github.com/dcanadillas-kube/environment-jenkins-x-lab-production.git) to change the version in ‘env/requirements.yaml’ file
* Merges the PR to change the version in the Master branch of the Production repo
* Triggers a promotion pipeline build that deploys the application version (same as Production git repo) into Production namespace in Kubernetes

Once the promotion build pipeline finishes (you can check as previous steps with ‘jx get activity -f jx-go-http’), you can check that the 0.0.2 version of the app is deployed into Production:
And now let’s check current version deployed into different environments (staging and production):

```bash
jx get version
```

Output (do not copy)

```sh
APPLICATION    STAGING PODS URL                                                   PRODUCTION PODS URL
jx-go-http     0.0.2   1/1  http://jx-go-http.jx-staging.35.189.194.245.nip.ioo   0.0.2      1/1  http://jx-go-http.jx-production.35.189.194.245.nip.io
```

Congratulations! You have finished this lab.

## Cleaning Up

If you want to leave your GitHub as it is was before doing this lab, you just need to delete the repos jx created for you here:

```bash
jx delete repo \
-n environment-jenkins-x-lab-production \
-n environment-jenkins-x-lab-staging \
-n jx-go-http
```

When prompted, answer the following questions:

* Git user name **<your_github_username>**
* Are you sure you want to delete these all these repositories? **Y**

Output (do not copy)

```sh
WARNING: You are about to delete these repositories 'environment-jenkins-x-lab-production,environment-jenkins-x-lab-staging' on the Git provider. This operation CANNOT be undone!
? Are you sure you want to delete these all these repositories? Yes
