# Create a Cluster

We are going to create a Kubernetes cluster with a Jenkins X platform deployed using the Jenkins X CLI. You will see that having a ready CI/CD Cloud Native platform from scratch is just a matter of minutes by executing some easy commands from the CLI.

> **Note**: In case you want to use the [Jenkins X Boot feature](https://jenkins-x.io/docs/reference/boot/) to create the cluster using GitOps, [use this lab](../JXBoot/JenkinsXBoot.md). If not, you can continue reading and create the cluster and deploy Jenkins X using the `jx create cluster` command from the CLI.

## Prepare the environment
Make sure the Google Cloud project you're working on is the one selected in the Cloud Web Console. This should be the case if you opened Cloud Shell with the right project selected:

```bash
gcloud config list project
```

Output (do not copy)
```
[core]
project = <your-project-id>
Your active configuration is: [cloudshell-30655]
```

If the output is not showing the proper project id, get it from the Google Console top menu and set it up with the following command:

```bash
gcloud config set project <your-project-id>
```

Now that your project ID is set, export the value to a shell variable for later use:

```bash
export PROJECT_ID=$(gcloud config get-value project)
```

## Create the cluster and install Jenkins X

Let's create a GKE cluster to host Jenkins X. To create the cluster, run the jx tool with the following options, substituting the zone for one that's more suitable to you depending on your physical location:

```bash
jx create cluster gke --no-tiller --skip-login --default-admin-password=admin --project-id=${PROJECT_ID} --cluster-name=jenkins-x-lab --zone=europe-west1-d --version=2.0.330
```

This command is interactive; it will guide you through creating a cluster on GKE by prompting you to answer some questions. Read on to know how to continue.

### Missing Dependencies

The jx command will attempt to locate any required dependencies first (particularly, Helm), if it discovers that some are missing (it will ask you to install helm, for example) it will prompt to install them for you in the ~/.jx/bin folder. Just answer yes for jx to install whatever dependencies are required.

### Configure you cluster

Follow the prompt to provide the following answers:
* Google Cloud Machine Type: n1-standard-2
* Minimum number of Nodes: 4
* Maximum number of Nodes: 6
* Would you like use preemptible VMs: N
* Would you like to access Google Cloud Storage / Google Container Registry: Y
* Would you like to enable Cloud Build, Container Registry & Container Analysis APIs:  Y
* Would you like to enable Kaniko for building container images: Y

Now jx is using the Google Cloud SDK to create a GKE cluster with the provided parameters. It will take some time before continuing with the configuration (up to five minutes), and will output something like this:

Output (do not copy)

```
INFO[0244] Creating cluster...
```

### GitHub Connectivity and default workload

Once the cluster is created, the jx execution continues and you will be prompted for some configuration options. There will be some delays between prompts when the jx command proceeds with different installation actions; just follow these answers for the different steps and you should be good to go:
1. Select Jenkins installation type:  **Serverless Jenkins X Pipelines with Tekton**
2. Please enter the name you wish to use with git: **enter your GitHub user as Git user**
3. Please enter the email address you wish to use with git: **enter your GitHub email as Git email address**
4. No existing ingress controller found in the kube-system namespace, shall we install one? **Y**
5. Domain **<your-ip>**.nip.io **Accept the proposed domain by pressing Enter**
6. Would you like to enable Long Term Storage? A bucket for provider gke will be created (Y/n) **Y**
7. GitHub user name: **enter your GitHub username**
8. API Token: **copy here the API Token generated in the GitHub page presented to you when you followed the suggested URL link in the terminal**
9. Do you wish to use GitHub as the pipelines Git server: **Yes**
10. API Token: **copy here the API Token generated in the GitHub page presented to you when you followed the suggested URL link in the terminal. Be careful, this is a new API token, different from the previous one**.
Now the installer will take a bit of time before continuing with the next steps.
11. Pick default workload build pack:   select the option **Kubernetes Workloads: Automated CI+CD with GitOps Promotion**
12. Select the organization where you want to create the environment repository: **select here the GitHub organization you have already configured**

> **Note:** the nip.io service you just used is just a way to have a static domain based on your IP.


The jx command should exit successfully showing an output similar to this:

(Output)

```
Jenkins X installation completed successfully

### What did Jenkins X just install?

Jenkins X installs different components in order to orchestrate Cloud Native CI/CD. These can be summarized conceptually as:
* Prow (Serverless Jenkins X): A webhook handler that listens to GitHub events and that uses ChatOps to trigger jobs to execute your pipeline
* Tekton: Using [tekton pipelines](https://github.com/tektoncd/pipeline) and Jenkins X controller a pipeline is decoupled into tasks and pipeline resources that are Kubernetes native objects
* Chartmuseum: Helm chart repository to publish different charts to be used during pipeline execution
* Nexus: Artifact cache management that can be required by some applications during the building or deployment
* Monocular: UI used for discovering and running Helm charts
The more detailed architecture of Jenkins X using Tekton (Serverless Jenkins X) can be described below:

![Tekton Jenkins X Architecture](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dcanadillas/jenkins-x-lab/master/images/TektonJXArch.png)

This is deployed to different pods and services in our development ‘jx’ namespace. So, let's take a look at what got installed based on the previous architecture diagram:

```bash
kubectl -n jx get pods
```

```

Jenkins X also created several secrets that it's using to authenticate to different services. You can have a look at them by running kubectl get secrets and observing how, for instance, there's a kaniko-secret stored to be used with Kaniko.
The jx command can also give you entry URLs for different services deployed by Jenkins X:

```bash
jx get urls
```

```

Note the deck URL that corresponds to Prow as we'll be using it to check that we're properly triggering  pipelines from GitHub events.
It is also now a good moment to have a look at how Jenkins X has created the environments and corresponding GitOps git repos,  as well as a default promotion strategy:

```bash
jx get environments
```

Output (do not copy)

```
NAME       LABEL       KIND        PROMOTE NAMESPACE     ORDER CLUSTER SOURCE                                                                       REF PR
dev        Development Development Never   jx            0
staging    Staging     Permanent   Auto    jx-staging    100           https://github.com/dcanadillas-kube/environment-jenkins-x-lab-staging.git
production Production  Permanent   Manual  jx-production 200           https://github.com/dcanadillas-kube/environment-jenkins-x-lab-production.git
```

Note the following details in the PROMOTE column:
* Development follows a **Never** promotion strategy, because we're not actually deploying anything and you're working locally.
* Staging follows a default **Auto** promotion strategy, meaning that any merge performed on the application's repo master branch will automatically deployed as a new version to staging.
* Production follows a **Manual** promotion strategy, meaning that you will use a jx promotion command to promote your staging application version into production.

SOURCE column reflects the corresponding environment configuration git repo.
